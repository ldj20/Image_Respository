# Image_Respository
This is Lawrence Jiang's Shopify Application.

After cloning the repository, you can run the server and client on two seperate terminal windows.

On both the root and /frontend directory, run "npm install".

Then on the root directory, run "npm run dev" to start the server and on the /frontend directory, run "npm start" to start the client.

**testing**
This is best done before extensively using the application; simply run "npm test" on the root directory.
